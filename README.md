# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Anas AIT AOMAR , an engineering student at Emines school of industrial management. Drifted by my curiosity and my love to research, i try to keep the balance between my daily consumption of machine learning materials and the creation of tools/projects to straighten my understanding but also patâ€™y back to the community via blogs and talks about machine learning and network( graph theory) field

# Projects and Articles
## Articles 
I love discovering new concepts in the tech field ,combined with my love for sharing and story telling . I tried in a series of blogs to explain some concepts that I'm interested in a friendly way 
- [Over-smoothing issue in graph neural network](https://towardsdatascience.com/over-smoothing-issue-in-graph-neural-network-bddc8fbc2472)

## Visual capsules 
I also love to sketch ideas to keep them simple and easy to grasp, that why I started a series of visually appealing  notes to help me and other people in their learning journey
